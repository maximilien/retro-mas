### Retro Summary

#### What Went Well
During this period, our team has achieved significant milestones, including:
1. The successful implementation of PQCP delivery for MLKEM, highlighting the strength of our collaboration with OQS.
2. A well-received blog post commemorating our one-year anniversary, showcasing our journey and accomplishments.
3. Productive engagement with RWPQC and meaningful collaborations with MITRE and SandboxAQ.
4. Hosting a well-attended happy hour in San Jose, which fostered team bonding and camaraderie.
5. Securing funding for crucial arm runners and the establishment of a proactive tools working group that looks to innovate further.
6. The formulation of a lifecycle policy and the automation of GitHub repo access using Bitwarden, significantly enhancing our operational efficiency.

#### What Went OK
While we celebrate our successes, there are areas that have yielded satisfactory results yet present opportunities for enhancement:
1. We have experienced broader participation, attracting more companies since our inception, which enriches our collaborative environment.
2. Our explorations with a telecom organization have been fruitful; although code adoption was not achieved, relationships formed are valuable.
3. Minute-taking for TAC meetings began using GitHub, but was hampered by changes in our LF facilitator. Revitalizing this practice could enhance our transparency and documentation.
4. Exploring different meeting timings could further maximize participation and engagement, as demonstrated by our practices in PQCP and OQS.

#### Areas for Improvement
Looking ahead, several actionable steps have emerged, which could elevate our project and collaboration:
1. Amplifying outreach efforts to attract a larger pool of contributors and maintainers, leveraging marketing communications such as blogs and social media.
2. Actively addressing concerns of dissatisfied contributors to enhance morale and foster a more inclusive environment.
3. Developing a LinkedIn Page for PQCA could centralize our communication efforts and enhance visibility in the community.
4. Addressing questions like "Where is Google?" can help clarify roles and responsibilities among stakeholders.
5. Tackling the issue of slow contributor growth and fostering open communication with project TSCs to drive collaboration.
6. Effectively utilizing LFX insights data to inform our planning and strategic decisions.
7. Establishing a structured onboarding process to warmly welcome new participants, ensuring they feel valued and engaged from the start.
8. Forming dedicated working groups that foster diversity and inclusion across various project types, enriching our collaborative landscape.
